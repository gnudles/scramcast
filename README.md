# scramcast
Small ditributed shared memory library. This library does not guarantee that all the messages arrives. It just assumes you have a good network infrastructure.
It aims to bring a good replacement for the scramnet card.
It supports up to 8mb share. Currently it is working but yet many features are missing.
